// Two horizontal lines connected at the left with a vertical line. The top line contains mostly blue circles and one red circle. The bottom line contains mostly red circles that are spaced more widely. There is a thin box on the top line labeled "Low B" and a wider box on the bottom line labeled "High B". At the bottom of the figure there is the text "Productivity >>>".
