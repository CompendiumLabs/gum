const e="# Plot\n\n*Inherits*: [Group](/docs/group) > [Element](/docs/element)\n\nThis will graph one or more elements over the desired limits and frame them with axes. If not specified by `xlim` and `ylim`, the limits of the plot will be computed from the bounding box of the constituent elements. By default, the `aspect` will be the ratio of the range of the `xlim` and `ylim`.\n\nParameters:\n- `xlim`/`ylim` = `[0, 1]` — the range over which to graph\n- `xanchor`/`yanchor` — the value at which to place the respective axis. Note that the `xanchor` is a y-value and vice versa. Defaults to `xmin`/`ymin`\n- `xticks`/`yticks` = `5` — either an integer for evenly spaced ticks, a list of tick locations, or list of tick `[location, label]` pairs (see [Axis](/docs/axis) for more details)\n- `xgrid`/`ygrid` = `false` — whether to show a grid in the background. If `true`, the grid lines match the specified ticks. Alternatively, you can pass a list of positions to override this\n- `xlabel`/`ylabel` — a string or **Element** to use as the respective label\n- `title` — a string or **Element** to use as the title\n\nSubunits:\n- `xaxis`/`yaxis`/`axis` — the axes, including lines, ticks, and tick labels\n- `xgrid`/`ygrid`/`grid` — the grid lines arrayed under the graph\n- `xlabel`/`ylabel`/`label` — the axis label elements\n- `title` — the title element\n";export{e as default};
